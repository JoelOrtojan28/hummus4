    	<p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. It deserves it.
    	All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
